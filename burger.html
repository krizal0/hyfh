<p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges. Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold. I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen. These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!</p>
<h3><b>Ingredients:</b></h3>
<ol>
    <li> 4 hamburger buns</li>
    <br>
    <li> 2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
    <br>
    <li> 1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
    <br>
    <li> 4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
    <br>
    <li> salt to taste</li>
    <br>
    <li> 4 slices American cheese</li>
    <br>
    <li> burger toppings of choice</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Directions:</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Step 1:</b></li>
    <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking. </p>
    <li><b>Step 2:</b></li>
    <p>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</p>
    <li><b>Step 3:</b></li>
    <p>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</p>
    <li><b>Step 4:</b></li>
    <p>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.</p>
</ul>
